Hello everyone, we are the iBehave Open Technology Support Group or iBOTS - That is Sangeetha and me, Ole, as well as Atle and the head of our group Nicholas. And we support the researchers in the iBehave network - so, you guys - with everything related to software. If you want to learn more about the work of our group you can do so on our fancy new website which you can find at ibots-bonn.de 
Let me give you a little overview.

One thing that we do is we offer helpdesk consulting. Whether you have questions about writing code, using a particular piece of software or implementing a new data analysis just drop us a message and we can chat and figure out how we can support you. Our new website makes this very easy - just go to consulting and scroll down, you can select any team memeber and send them a message right there. We are always very happy to get involved in research projects so please do not hesitate to contact us!

::: {.notes}
We would also like to the Projects section of our website to highlight computational work and software that is developed within iBehave.
For example, here you can see the LarvaWorld project that Panos presented yesterday.
So if you have a project that you would like to share, please get in touch with us.

The other thing we do is we develop and host workshops that combine general programming education with neuroscience data and applications. These workshops are online and social, focused on hands-on collaborative work. It's very important to us that we put you in the driver's seat so you can engage with the learning materials and practice your skills.

On our website, you can get an overview of our curriculum: there are general introductions to computational tools and programming, courses on neuroscientific modalities like calclium imaging and local field potentials as well as more advanced software engineering topics like building applications or managing databases.
You can also see all of our upcoming courses here on the left: For example, there is a course on data management with DataLad next Friday - if you are interested, there are still some open slots. You can also join our mailing list.

Now I am curious: Who here in the audience has participates in one of our workshops before?
Okay, and who of you of you has revisited the workshop materials after the workshop was over to look something up?

We weren't satisfied with how we archived our learning materials and made them available. While we open source all of our materials on GitHub, the repositories are focused on individual events. This means that there exist multiple versions of the same course which makes it challenging to understand what the latest version of a given course is, even for ourselves. Today we present you our solution to this challenge which is our new iBOTS Learning Website

## Introducing: the iBOTs Learning Website
### Self-Paced Learning and Knowledge Sharing

::: {.fragment}
**Goals of [learn.ibots-bonn.de](learn.ibots-bonn.de)**
:::

:::{.incremental}
- Highlight our materials and **share** them with iBehave and the wider neuroscience community
- Make it easy and engaging to **find**, **explore** and **use** the course materials
- Create a platform for **others** to share their knowledge
:::

::: {.notes}
Our goal was to create a single place to highlight all of our course materials and share them with the iBehave researchers but also with the neuroscience community in general because we think these materials are good and we want everyone to profit from them.

We wanted to make it easy for you as a user to find course materials that interest you, explore interactively and download them to use them on your own machine.

And then finally, in the future, we want to turn this site into a proper learning platform that helps others to share their knwoledge as well. So if you have or are developing learning materials that you think deserve more visibility please get in touch with us.

And with that I'm gonna hand the mic over to Sangeetha who is going to give a tour of our site.

Okay so let's say you want to do one of our courses for example the Intro to Python for Scientists.

Currently, there are two different ways of doing this.
Option 1 is to download the materials and run them on your own machine.
For this, you have to install the computational environment that contains the software dependencies required for the course.
If you go to the landing page of the course, you'll see an Installation section with instructions on setting up the environment. 
We currently support two package managers, pixi and conda - I'm gonna choose pixi because its modern and fast.
If you are not familar with these tools, we have lessons on how to use them as well!

You click here to download the pixi.toml file that contains a comprehensive description of the environment and run this command to install and activate it.
Once you have the environment you can simply open a lesson and click the "Download Exercises" button at the top of the page.
Next, you just need to open the notebook in your editor, select the installed environment and start coding.

If you want to do the lessons without doing any setup we offer an alternative way.
You can click the "Open in JupyterLite" button to open and interactive notebook where you can write and execute code.
The cool thing here is that this does not run on some server but actually runs the code pon your machine in the browser, powered by a technology called WebAssembly.

In the future, we want to support additional ways of interacting with our materials like Google Colab or Binder so every user can choose the method they prefer.

## Thank you for your Attention!
### We look forward to hearing from you
