## The iBehave Open Technology Support

### Improving Neuroscience Software Through Teaching and Collaboration

- We are scientists who focus on research software
- We support researchers in the iBehave network
- You can learn more about our group at [ibots-bonn.de](ibots-bonn.de)!

Hello everyone, we are the iBehave Open Technology Support Group or iBOTS - That is Sangeetha and me, Ole, as well as Atle and the head of our group Nicholas. And we support the researchers in the iBehave network - so, you guys - with everything related to software. If you want to learn more about the work of our group you can do so on our fancy new website which you can find at ibots-bonn.de 
Let me give you a little overview.

One thing that we do is we offer helpdesk consulting. Whether you have questions about writing code, using a particular piece of software or implementing a new data analysis just drop us a message and we can chat and figure out how we can support you. Our new website makes this very easy - just go to consulting and scroll down, you can select any team memeber and send them a message right there. We are always very happy to get involved in research projects so please do not hesitate to contact us!

The other thing we do is we develop and host workshops that combine general programming education with neuroscience data and applications. These workshops are online and social, focused on hands-on collaborative work. It's very important to us that we put you in the driver's seat so you can engage with the learning materials and practice your skills.

On our website, you can get an overview of our curriculum: there are general introductions to computational tools and programming, courses on neuroscientific modalities like calclium imaging and local field potentials as well as more advanced software engineering topics like building applications or managing databases.
You can also see all of our upcoming courses here on the left: For example, there is a course on data management with DataLad next Friday - if you are interested, there are still some open slots.

Now I am curious: Who here in the audience has participates in one of our workshops before?
Okay, and who of you of you has revisited the workshop materials after the workshop was over to look something up?

We weren't satisfied with how we archived our learning materials and made them available. While we open source all of our materials on GitHub, the repositories are focused on individual events. This means that there exist multiple versions of the same course which makes it challenging to understand what the latest version of a given course is, even for ourselves. Today we present you our solution to this challenge: the iBOTS Learning Website
